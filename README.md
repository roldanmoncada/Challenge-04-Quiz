# Challenge-04-Quiz

## Description:
  This app is a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. It runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by Javascript code. Further usage instructions can be found as part of the screenshots section below.

  Currently, the quiz is not 100% perfect, but I did want to submit it for a grade since being a perfectionist won't help in catching up on late homeworks. My recent updates/debugs have come via syntax corrections. This was a very dense chunk of code so I often found myself forgetting what I named certain variables and functions. The quiz is functional, nonetheless! I know how to make this more efficient but starting over would've taken more time than debugging/correcting syntax errors. Looking forward to the feedback on this one!

  The assignment's User Story and Acceptance Criteria can be found in their own sections below.
  
## User Story:

  Upon clicking the start button, users will be taken to the first question of the quiz and are presented with 4 options of possible answers. Users will be alerted if their selected response is correct or incorrect by a brief pop-up. This is hard to capture with a screenshot, unfortunately.There is also a 60 second timer that counts down as soon as the quiz is started located at the top right of the screen.

  After answering all questions, the user will be presented with a score, an input box for their name, and a submit button to save it to local storage.
